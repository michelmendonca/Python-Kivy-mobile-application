Python|Kivy mobile application

Project descriptionThis application intended to provide the user with a "Lucky Number" so the user can expect to get "lucky" enough to win a prize through a draw with other "lucky numbers" of other users. Alternatively, the user can provide his own "Lucky number".

This application requires the user to create an account; then, it allows the user to log in to the application. Once logged in, the user can choose his lucky number or choose it randomly by clicking some buttons.

The App was developed using Python for the main script and two database scripts, account creation and lucky numbers. For the basic UX, I used the Kivy language.
